			<h1>About the project</h1>
			<p>The ProMo-Sense project aims for the development and implementation of a proximity sensor alarm system. The system is designed to enhance security and area-monitoring by detecting the presence of individuals within a specified environment.</p>
			<p>The proximity sensor is equipped with both a physical and a digital code-lock module to control and authorize entry. In simpler terms, this means that individuals seeking access must input a specific code to the code-lock module to disable the alarm for a specified time period.</p>
			<p>The users of the alarm system will also be able to interact intelligently with a corresponding website that manages user authentication, log-in and log-out activities and where the features of the system can be adjusted. This system, unlike traditional ones, differs in the sense that it provides users with a portable, user-friendly sensor and customizable audio sample that enhances security for personal belongings, even while travelings!</p>

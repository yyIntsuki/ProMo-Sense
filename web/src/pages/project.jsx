			<h1>About the project</h1>
			<p>The ProMo-Sense project aims for the development and implementation of a proximity sensor alarm system. The system is designed to enhance security and area-monitoring by detecting the presence of individuals within a specified environment.</p>
			<p>The proximity sensor is equipped with a code-lock and access card mechanism to control and authorize entry. In simpler terms, this means that individuals seeking access must first scan the tag and input a specific code to disable the alarm for a specific time period.</p>
			<p>The users of the alarm system will also be able to interact intelligently with a corresponding website that manages user authentication, log-in and log-out activities and where the features of the system can be adjusted. This system, unlike traditional ones, differs in the sense that it provides users with a portable, user-friendly sensor that enhances security for personal belongings, even while travelings!</p>
